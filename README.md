# helvetic

*helvetic* is an application that replaces the web service for the FitBit Aria.

It can be either run as Python webserver or on ESP32 with BLE support.

The software is a work-in-progress, and runs as a Django application.  It also includes a bare-bones implementation of the protocol for testing, which uses bottle.py (and stores no data).

It requires local DNS spoofing in order to intercept requests originally bound for `fitbit.com`.

## Currently implemented

* Recording data
* Sending preferences and 1-2 user profiles to Aria
* Registering new device

## Partially implemented

* Viewing data (through Django Admin)
* Configuration manager (through Django Admin)
* Profile manager (through Django Admin)
* Sending more than 1 user profile to Aria

## Planned

* WiFi connection setup & complete registration flow
* Replacing bits that depend on Django Admin
* User management
* Data access
* Graphs
